webpack.config.js

- moduleer bundler
- require path

module.export = {

}

entry = the main root file or the entry file
'./app/index.js'

- it will look at the entry point and combined all the files and then output it

output (
path: path.reslove(\_\_direnamem 'dist') makes the dist folder
filename: 'index_bundle.js' name of that file that is bundled
)
